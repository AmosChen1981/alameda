# What is Alameda

<h3><strong>The Brain of Resources Orchestrator for Kubernetes</strong></h3>

As the brain of Kubernetes resource orchestrator, Alameda provides the predictive analytics for the automation of scaling and scheduling of containers by using machine learning technologies, as well as justifies your cloud strategy with full foresight of resource availability, demands, health, impacts and return.

Alameda learns the continuing changes of compute and I/O metrics from clusters, predicts future demands of pods and resource availability of nodes, and generates intelligent resource configuration recommendation. The prediction and recommendation generated by Alameda can facilitate predictive container and storage orchestration tasks, such as pod auto-scaling, scheduler, cluster auto-scaling, and persistent volume provisioning, etc.

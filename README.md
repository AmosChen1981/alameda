# What is Alameda
Intelligent Resources Orchestrator for Kubernetes by using machine learning

Alameda is an intelligent resource orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the features of autonomous balancing, scaling and scheduling by using machine learning.

Alameda learns the continuing changes of compute and I/O metrics from clusters, predicts the future demands for pods, and intelligently orchestrates underlying resources to fulfill the dynamic resource requests without manual configuration.

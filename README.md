# What is Alameda

<h3><strong>Intelligent Resources Orchestrator for Kubernetes by using machine learning</strong></h3>

Alameda is an intelligent resource orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the features of autonomous balancing, scaling and scheduling by using machine learning.

Alameda learns the continuing changes of compute and I/O metrics from clusters, predicts the future demands for pods, and intelligently orchestrates underlying resources to fulfill the dynamic resource requests without manual configuration.

**Architecture of Alameda**

Alameda aims to be an intelligent resource orchestrator. It plays the role as the brain for Kubernertes clusters. Generally, it has three modules, the data collector module, the AI module, and the execution module. 

* Data Collector Module: Retreiving metrics from Prometheous and passing data to the AI Module
* AI Module: Generating prediction results based on multiple machine learning algorithms. Also generating resource configuration plans.
* Execution Module: Execute the resource configuration plans generated by the AI Module
